this Java Netbeans project is a desktop application that compares files into two different folders 
and gets the list of files found to be the same and user can choose to delete the files.

This is designed to remove the files that one already has so as to save space like for instance i used
to download videos  but i would change location the i realized that i could have downloaded the same video 
but i dint know how to compare or check .

I hope you will use this to help you learn more on using the fileI/O class in java

usage :import using Netbeans and be sure that you have java 8. as i have employed lambda expressions.
Please do note that this is just for educational reasons feel free to use the code for what ever.
